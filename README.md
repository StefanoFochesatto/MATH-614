# MATH-614
University of Alaska Math 614 Numerical Linear Algebra

## Description
This course included topics on algorithms and theory for stable and accurate computation using matrices and vectors on computers. Matrix factorizations, direct and iterative methods for solving linear systems, least squares, eigenvalue and singular value decompositions. Practical implementation and application of algorithms. My favorite topic of the course came from our discussion of the google PageRank algorithm in [homework 9](https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/MATH-614/blob/main/Coursework/Homework%20%239/Homework%20%239.pdf).
